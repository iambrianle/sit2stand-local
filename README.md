Installation and Setup
To get started, clone the repository at https://github.com/iambrianle/sit2stand-local and install OpenPose using the guide at this repository. Install Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file in the cloned repository.

Running the Code
First, run main.py on your video to generate JSON files, then use prepare.py to create an npy file. Update the links.csv file with appropriate file names and paths, and finally run getmetrics.py to produce graphs, charts, and results. Remember to adjust paths in all Python files to match your system.
